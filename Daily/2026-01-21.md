### Meeting Notes
**Current Ticket Status**
- Mikal has ~15 tickets in progress.
- Closing out one create account ticket; two more to complete.
- New incident from Chris: Blank purchase code in purchase requisition screen (field marked mandatory in IFS).
- Reassignments happening due to team moves.

**Ticket Counting Discrepancy Resolved**
- Resolved discrepancy where Mikal's report showed 37 records vs system's 28.
- **Key Decision**: Program logic updated to count *all* tickets with a resolved/closed time within the date range, regardless of final status (Closed, Cancelled, Transferred).
- Clarification: "Transfer work" and "Transfer none" tickets should be counted.
    - *Transfer work*: Initial work done then transferred.
    - *Transfer none*: Acknowledge and transfer.

**Monthly Report Generation Process**
- Current process is manual (Excel tabs, extracting data, removing open tickets, creating charts, copying to PPT).
- **Goal**: Automate this to "just one click".
- Future plan: Move from Excel to database.

**Development Effort Tracking**
- Tracking hours against contracted 16h/month for Morali.
- Unused hours carry over.
- Proposal: Create new "effort" tab in NA Daily to centralize this data.

**IFS Academy Certification**
- Mikal (9 months tenure) should prioritize certification.
- Target: 1 hour every Sunday + 30 mins during workday.
- Focus: IFS Cloud (80% of clients moving to cloud).

**Company Growth & Team**
- New marketing hire (Aki-san) to bring new clients.
- Need professional reporting for new clients.
- Team growth: Aiming for 5 members, eventually 30-40.
- Tatsuo transitioning to management/delegation.
- Importance of retaining trained employees (compensation matching value).

**Work Style**

- Recommendation: Taking regular breaks (every 1-2 hours) for focus.
